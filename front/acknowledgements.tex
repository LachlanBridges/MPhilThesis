\begin{chapter}{Acknowledgements}
\label{ch:acknowledgements}
I must sincerely thank my supervisors, Giang Nguyen and Nigel Bean, for all of their help and guidance throughout the last two years of research, and for the numerous drafts they have read.
Not only are they both excellent mathematicians, but patient teachers, and warm and friendly people.
I always found great value in our meetings, as well as great enjoyment.

I would also like to give an extra thanks to Giang, for her encouragement and assistance over the last three and a half years.
She has always gone above and beyond when assisting me, whether it be helping with applications, summer research, or encouraging me to present my work at conferences.
Without her help I would have never began my masters, and would certainly not be where I am today.

It would be remiss of me not to thank my family and friends that have all supported me in various ways.
In particular, I am grateful to my wife Fern, my sister Emily, and my brother Nick, as well as Ludovica, Cameron, Michael, and Ben.

Last and certainly not least, I would like to express the utmost gratitude to my parents, Heather and Geoff, for all of their love and support throughout my entire academic journey.
